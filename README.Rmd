# cbds_reports

The goal of cbds_reports is to create reports for chromebook data science classes.  

To compile reports, you can simply run `make_reports.R`, but you must have `student_df.rds` in your folder.  This file is not hosted on GitHub because it has student names in there.  It should be located on a Google Document that all collaborators on the repo have access to.
