# cbds\_reports

The goal of cbds\_reports is to create reports for chromebook data
science classes.

To compile reports, you can simply run `make_reports.R`, but you must
have `student_df.rds` in your folder. This file is not hosted on GitHub
because it has student names in there. It should be located on a Google
Document that all collaborators on the repo have access to.
